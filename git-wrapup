USAGE: git-wrapup <branch>

# summary

wrap up the feature branch that you're working on.

# more info

if <branch> is not given, then use the current branch.

fail if <branch> is 'master' or 'production'. because those probably aren't
features ;)

# implementation details

git-wrapup deletes the branch and its remote tracking branch.

if the branch's remote is origin, then delete the remote branch as well.

if the branch's remote is something other than origin, then presumably you can't
delete the remote, so just remove the branch from the list of fetched branches
in .git/config. this works well with the hub(1) command's feature that checks
out pull requests to your local repo.

# integration

descriptive branch names can be long, so it's helpful to have command line
completion with this command. this is pretty easy if you're using bash and
you've already got git completion setup for bash. if you do, then add this
script to your \$PATH, make it a git alias:

    $ git config --global alias.wrapup '!git-wrapup'

and then add this line to your bash startup script (~/.bashrc or whatever):

    if which git &>/dev/null && grep wrapup ~/.gitconfig &>/dev/null; then
      _git_wrapup() { _git_branch; }
